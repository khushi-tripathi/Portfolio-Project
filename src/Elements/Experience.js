                    <p className="para">PetWhoody is an online platform where people can adopt a pet or get their beloved animals adopted. The main purpose of this initiative is to connect people who need to adopt pets or are looking for lovely families who can take a good care of their pets. The platform is made in such a way that is easier for the users to use, interact and connect, ensuring the highest security of their personal data.
Our project facilitates the people who either seek to adopt pets or wish to give away their pets for adoption. This project also aims to provide shelters to abandoned pets and street animals if reported.</p>
